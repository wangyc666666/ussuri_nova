OpenStack Compute supports many hypervisors, which might make it difficult for
you to choose one. Most installations use only one hypervisor.  However, you
can use :ref:`ComputeFilter` and :ref:`ImagePropertiesFilter` to schedule
different hypervisors within the same installation.  The following links help
you choose a hypervisor.  See :doc:`/user/support-matrix` for a detailed list
of features and support across the hypervisors.

The following hypervisors are supported:

* `KVM`_ - Kernel-based Virtual Machine. The virtual disk formats that it
  supports is inherited from QEMU since it uses a modified QEMU program to
  launch the virtual machine. The supported formats include raw images, the
  qcow2, and VMware formats.

* `LXC`_ - Linux Containers (through libvirt), used to run Linux-based virtual
  machines.

* `QEMU`_ - Quick EMUlator, generally only used for development purposes.

* `VMware vSphere`_ 5.1.0 and newer - Runs VMware-based Linux and Windows
  images through a connection with a vCenter server.

* `Xen (using libvirt)`_ - Xen Project Hypervisor using libvirt as
  management interface into ``nova-compute`` to run Linux, Windows, FreeBSD and
  NetBSD virtual machines.

* `XenServer`_ - XenServer, Xen Cloud Platform (XCP) and other XAPI based Xen
  variants runs Linux or Windows virtual machines. You must install the
  ``nova-compute`` service in a para-virtualized VM.

* `Hyper-V`_ - Server virtualization with Microsoft Hyper-V, use to run
  Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD virtual machines.  Runs ``nova-compute`` natively
  on the Windows virtualization platform.

* `Virtuozzo`_ 7.0.0 and newer - OS Containers and Kernel-based Virtual
  Machines supported via libvirt virt_type=parallels. The supported formats
  include ploop and qcow2 images.

* `PowerVM`_ - Server virtualization with IBM PowerVM for AIX, IBM i, and Linux
  workloads on the Power Systems platform.

* `zVM`_ - Server virtualization on z Systems and IBM LinuxONE, it can run Linux,
  z/OS and more.

* `UML`_ - User-Mode Linux is a safe, secure way of running Linux versions and Linux
  processes.

* `Ironic`_ - OpenStack project which provisions bare metal (as opposed to virtual)
  machines.
