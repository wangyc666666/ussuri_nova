Chronological PTL guide
=======================

This is just a reference guide that a PTL may use as an aid, if they choose.

New PTL
-------

* Update the nova meeting chair

  * https://github.com/openstack-infra/irc-meetings/blob/master/meetings/nova-team-meeting.yaml

* Update the team wiki

  * https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Nova#People

* Get acquainted with the release schedule

  * Example: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Nova/Stein_Release_Schedule

Project Team Gathering
----------------------

* Create PTG planning etherpad, retrospective etherpad and alert about it in
  nova meeting and dev mailing list

  * Example: https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/nova-ptg-stein

* Run sessions at the PTG

* Have a priorities discussion at the PTG

  * Example: https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/nova-ptg-stein-priorities

* Sign up for group photo at the PTG (if applicable)

* Open review runways for the cycle

  * Example: https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/nova-runways-stein

After PTG
---------

* Send PTG session summaries to the dev mailing list

* Make sure the cycle priorities spec gets reviewed and merged

  * Example: https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/priorities/stein-priorities.html

* Run the count-blueprints script daily to gather data for the cycle burndown chart

A few weeks before milestone 1
------------------------------

* Plan a spec review day

* Periodically check the series goals others have proposed in the “Set series
  goals” link:

  * Example: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/stein/+setgoals

Milestone 1
-----------

* Do milestone release of nova and python-novaclient (in launchpad only)

  * This is launchpad bookkeeping only. With the latest release team changes,
    projects no longer do milestone releases. See: https://releases.openstack.org/reference/release_models.html#cycle-with-milestones-legacy

  * For nova, set the launchpad milestone release as “released” with the date

* Release other libraries if there are significant enough changes since last
  release. When releasing the first version of a library for the cycle, bump
  the minor version to leave room for future stable branch releases

  * os-vif

* Release stable branches of nova

  * ``git checkout <stable branch>``

  * ``git log --no-merges <last tag>..``

    * Examine commits that will go into the release and use it to decide
      whether the release is a major, minor, or revision bump according to
      semver

  * Then, propose the release with version according to semver x.y.z

    * X - backward-incompatible changes

    * Y - features

    * Z - bug fixes

  * Use the new-release command to generate the release

    * https://releases.openstack.org/reference/using.html#using-new-release-command

Summit
------

* Prepare the project update presentation. Enlist help of others

* Prepare the on-boarding session materials. Enlist help of others

A few weeks before milestone 2
------------------------------

* Plan a spec review day (optional)

* Periodically check the series goals others have proposed in the “Set series
  goals” link:

  * Example: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/stein/+setgoals

Milestone 2
-----------

* Spec freeze

* Release nova and python-novaclient

* Release other libraries as needed

* Stable branch releases of nova

* For nova, set the launchpad milestone release as “released” with the date

Shortly after spec freeze
-------------------------

* Create a blueprint status etherpad to help track, especially non-priority
  blueprint work, to help things get done by Feature Freeze (FF). Example:

  * https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/nova-stein-blueprint-status

* Create or review a patch to add the next release’s specs directory so people
  can propose specs for next release after spec freeze for current release

Non-client library release freeze
---------------------------------

* Final release for os-vif

Milestone 3
-----------

* Feature freeze day

* Client library freeze, release python-novaclient

* Close out all blueprints, including “catch all” blueprints like mox,
  versioned notifications

* Stable branch releases of nova

* For nova, set the launchpad milestone release as “released” with the date

Week following milestone 3
--------------------------

* Consider announcing the FFE (feature freeze exception process) to have people
  propose FFE requests to a special etherpad where they will be reviewed and
  possibly sponsored:

  * https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/contributor/process.html#non-priority-feature-freeze

  * Note: if there is only a short time between FF and RC1 (lately it’s been 2
    weeks), then the only likely candidates will be low-risk things that are
    almost done

A few weeks before RC
---------------------

* Make a RC1 todos etherpad and tag bugs as ``<release>-rc-potential`` and keep
  track of them, example:

  * https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/nova-stein-rc-potential

* Go through the bug list and identify any rc-potential bugs and tag them

RC
--

* Do steps described on the release checklist wiki:

  * https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Nova/ReleaseChecklist

* If we want to drop backward-compat RPC code, we have to do a major RPC
  version bump and coordinate it just before the major release:

  * https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/RpcMajorVersionUpdates

  * Example: https://review.opendev.org/541035

* “Merge latest translations" means translation patches

  * Check for translations with:

    * https://review.opendev.org/#/q/status:open+project:openstack/nova+branch:master+topic:zanata/translations

* Should NOT plan to have more than one RC if possible. RC2 should only happen
  if there was a mistake and something was missed for RC, or a new regression
  was discovered

* Do the RPC version aliases just before RC1 if no further RCs are planned.
  Else do them at RC2. In the past, we used to update all service version
  aliases (example: https://review.opendev.org/230132) but since we really
  only support compute being backlevel/old during a rolling upgrade, we only
  need to update the compute service alias, see related IRC discussion:
  http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/irclogs/%23openstack-nova/%23openstack-nova.2018-08-08.log.html#t2018-08-08T17:13:45

  * Example: https://review.opendev.org/642599

  * More detail on how version aliases work: https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/configuration/config.html#upgrade-levels

* Write the reno prelude for the release GA

  * Example: https://review.opendev.org/644412

* Write the cycle-highlights in marketing-friendly sentences and propose to the
  openstack/releases repo. Usually based on reno prelude but made more readable
  and friendly

  * Example: https://review.opendev.org/644697

Immediately after RC
--------------------

* Look for bot proposed changes to reno and stable/<cycle>

* Follow the post-release checklist

  * https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Nova/ReleaseChecklist

  * Add database migration placeholders

    * Example: https://review.opendev.org/650964

  * Drop old RPC compat code (if there was a RPC major version bump)

    * Example: https://review.opendev.org/543580

* Create the launchpad series for the next cycle

* Set the development focus of the project to the new cycle series

* Set the status of the new series to “active development”

* Set the last series status to “current stable branch release”

* Set the previous to last series status to “supported”

* Repeat launchpad steps ^ for python-novaclient

* Register milestones in launchpad for the new cycle based on the new cycle
  release schedule

* Make sure the specs directory for the next cycle gets created so people can
  start proposing new specs

* Make sure to move implemented specs from the previous release

  * Use ``tox -e move-implemented-specs <release>``

  * Also remove template from ``doc/source/specs/<release>/index.rst``

  * Also delete template file ``doc/source/specs/<release>/template.rst``

* Create new release wiki:

  * Example: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Nova/Train_Release_Schedule

Miscellaneous Notes
-------------------

How to approve a launchpad blueprint
************************************

* Set the approver as the person who +W the spec, or set to self if it’s
  specless

* Set the Direction => Approved and Definition => Approved and make sure the
  Series goal is set to the current release. If code is already proposed, set
  Implementation => Needs Code Review

* Add a comment to the Whiteboard explaining the approval, with a date
  (launchpad does not record approval dates). For example: “We discussed this
  in the team meeting and agreed to approve this for <release>. -- <nick>
  <YYYYMMDD>”

How to complete a launchpad blueprint
*************************************

* Set Implementation => Implemented. The completion date will be recorded by
  launchpad
