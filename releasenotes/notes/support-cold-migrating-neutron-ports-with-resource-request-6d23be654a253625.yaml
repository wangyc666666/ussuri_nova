    Cold migration and resize are now supported for servers with neutron ports
    having resource requests. E.g. ports that have QoS minimum bandwidth rules
    attached. Note that the migration is only supported if both the source and
    the destination compute services are upgraded to Train and the
    ``[upgrade_levels]/compute`` configuration does not prevent the computes
    from using the latest RPC version.
