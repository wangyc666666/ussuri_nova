    `Bug 1845986`_ has been fixed by adding iommu driver when the following
    metadata options are used with AMD SEV:

    - ``hw_scsi_model=virtio-scsi`` and either ``hw_disk_bus=scsi`` or
      ``hw_cdrom_bus=scsi``
    - ``hw_video_model=virtio``

    Also a virtio-serial controller is created when ``hw_qemu_guest_agent=yes``
    option is used, together with iommu driver for it.
