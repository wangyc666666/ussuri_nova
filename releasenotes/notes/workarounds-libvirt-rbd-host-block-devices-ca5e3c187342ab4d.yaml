    The ``[workarounds]/rbd_volume_local_attach`` configuration option has been
    introduced. This can be used by operators to ensure RBD volumes are
    connected to compute hosts as block devices. This can be used with
    the ``[worarounds]/disable_native_luksv1`` configuration option to
    workaround recently discovered performance issues found within the
    `libgcrypt library`__ used by QEMU when natively decrypting LUKSv1
    encrypted disks.

    This workaround does not currently support extending attached volumes.

    This workaround is temporary and will be removed during the W release once
    all impacted distributions have been able to update their versions of the
    libgcrypt library.

    .. warning:: Operators must ensure no instances are running on the compute
      host before enabling this workaround. Any instances with attached RBD
      volumes left running on the hosts will fail to migrate or stop after this
      workaround has been enabled.
