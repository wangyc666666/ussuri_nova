    The scheduler can now use placement to more efficiently query for hosts that support
    the disk_format of the image used in a given request. The
    ``[scheduler]/query_placement_for_image_type_support`` config
    option enables this behavior, but must not be turned on until all
    computes have been upgraded to this version and thus are exposing image
    type support traits.
