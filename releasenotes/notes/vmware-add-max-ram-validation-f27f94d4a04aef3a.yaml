    For the VMware vCenter driver, added support for the configured video ram ``hw_video_ram`` from the image,
    which will be checked against the maximum allowed video ram ``hw_video:ram_max_mb``
    from the flavor.
    If the selected video ram from the image is less than or equal to the maximum allowed ram,
    the ``videoRamSizeInKB`` will be set.
    If the selected ram is more than the maximum allowed one, then server creation will fail for the given
    image and flavor.
    If the maximum allowed video ram is not set in the flavor we do not set ``videoRamSizeInKB`` in the VM.
