features:
  - Microversion 2.67 adds the optional parameter ``volume_type`` to
    block_device_mapping_v2, which can be used to specify ``volume_type``
    when creating a server.

    This would only apply to BDMs with ``source_type`` of `blank`, `image` and
    `snapshot` and ``destination_type`` of `volume`.

    The compute API will reject server create requests with a specified
    ``volume_type`` until all nova-compute services are upgraded to Stein.
