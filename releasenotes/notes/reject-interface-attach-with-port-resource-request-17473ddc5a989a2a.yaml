    The ``POST /servers/{server_id}/os-interface`` request will be rejected
    with HTTP 400 if the Neutron port referenced in the request body has
    resource request as Nova currently cannot support such operation. For
    example a Neutron port has resource request if a `QoS minimum bandwidth
    rule`_ is attached to that port in Neutron.

    .. _QoS minimum bandwidth rule: https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/latest/admin/config-qos-min-bw.html
