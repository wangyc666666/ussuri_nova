    This release moves the ``vrouter`` VIF plug and unplug code to a
    separate package called ``contrail-nova-vif-driver``. This package is a
    requirement on compute nodes when using Contrail, OpenContrail or
    Tungsten Fabric as a Neutron plugin.
    At this time, the reference plugin is hosted on OpenContrail at
    https://github.com/Juniper/contrail-nova-vif-driver but is expected to
    transition to Tungsten Fabric in the future.
    Release ``r5.1.alpha0`` or later of the plugin is required, which will
    be included in Tungsten Fabric 5.1.
