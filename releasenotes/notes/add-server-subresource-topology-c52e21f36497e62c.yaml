    Microversion 2.78 adds a new ``topology`` sub-resource to the
    servers API:

    - ``GET /servers/{server_id}/topology``

    This API provides information about the NUMA topology of a server,
    including instance to host CPU pin mappings, if CPU pinning is used, and
    pagesize information.

    The information exposed by this API is admin or owner only by default,
    controlled by rule:

    - ``compute:server:topology:index``

    And following fine control policy  use to keep host only information to
    admin:

    - ``compute:server:topology:host:index``
