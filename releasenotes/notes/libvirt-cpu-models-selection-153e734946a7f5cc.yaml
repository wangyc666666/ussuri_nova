features:

    It is now possible to specify an ordered list of CPU models in the
    ``[libvirt] cpu_models`` config option. If ``[libvirt] cpu_mode``
    is set to ``custom``, the libvirt driver will select the first
    CPU model in this list that can provide the required feature
    traits.

    The ``[libvirt] cpu_model`` config option has been renamed to
    ``[libvirt] cpu_models`` and now accepts a list of CPU models.
