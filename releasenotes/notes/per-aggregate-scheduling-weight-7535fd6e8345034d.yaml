    Added the ability to allow users to use
    ``Aggregate``'s ``metadata`` to override the global config options
    for weights to achieve more fine-grained control over resource
    weights.

    Such as, for the CPUWeigher, it weighs hosts based on available vCPUs
    on the compute node, and multiplies it by the cpu weight multiplier. If
    per-aggregate value (which the key is "cpu_weight_multiplier") is found,
    this value would be chosen as the cpu weight multiplier. Otherwise, it
    will fall back to the ``[filter_scheduler]/cpu_weight_multiplier``. If
    more than one value is found for a host in aggregate metadata, the minimum
    value will be used.
