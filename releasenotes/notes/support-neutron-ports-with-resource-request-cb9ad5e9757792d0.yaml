    API microversion 2.72 adds support for creating servers with neutron ports
    that has resource request, e.g. neutron ports with
    `QoS minimum bandwidth rule`_. Deleting servers with such ports have
    already been handled properly as well as detaching these type of ports.

    API limitations:

    * Creating servers with Neutron networks having QoS minimum bandwidth rule
      is not supported.

    * Attaching Neutron ports and networks having QoS minimum bandwidth rule
      is not supported.

    * Moving (resizing, migrating, live-migrating, evacuating,
      unshelving after shelve offload) servers with ports having resource
      request is not yet supported.
