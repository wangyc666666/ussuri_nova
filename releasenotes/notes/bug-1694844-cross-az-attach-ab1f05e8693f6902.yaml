    Long standing `bug 1694844`_ is now fixed where the following conditions
    would lead to a 400 error response during server create:

    * ``[cinder]/cross_az_attach=False``
    * ``[DEFAULT]/default_schedule_zone=None``
    * A server is created without an availability zone specified but with
      pre-existing volume block device mappings

    Before the bug was fixed, users would have to specify an availability zone
    that matches the zone that the volume(s) were in. With the fix, the compute
    API will implicitly create the server in the zone that the volume(s) are
    in as long as the volume zone is not the same as the
    ``[DEFAULT]/default_availability_zone`` value (defaults to ``nova``).
