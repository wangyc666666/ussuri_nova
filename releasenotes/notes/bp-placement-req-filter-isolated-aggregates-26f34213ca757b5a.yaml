    Blueprint `placement-req-filter-forbidden-aggregates`_ adds the ability
    for operators to set traits on aggregates which if not requested in flavor
    extra specs or image properties will result in disallowing all hosts
    belonging to those aggregates from booting the requested instances. This
    feature is enabled via a new config option
    ``[scheduler]/enable_isolated_aggregate_filtering``.
    See `Filtering hosts by isolated aggregates`_ for more details.
