    Prior to this release Nova determined if ``UEFI`` support should be
    enable solely by checking host support as reported in `bug 1845628`_.

    Nova now correctly check for guest os support via the ``hw_firmware_type``
    image metadata property when spawning new instance and only
    enables ``UEFI`` if the guest and host support it.
    Guest deletion has also been updated to correctly clean up based on
    the ``UEFI`` or ``BIOS`` configuration of the vm.
