deprecations:
  - |
    The ``RetryFilter`` is deprecated and will be removed in an upcoming
    release. Since the 17.0.0 (Queens) release, the scheduler has provided
    alternate hosts for rescheduling so the scheduler does not need to be
    called during a reschedule which makes the ``RetryFilter`` useless.
    See the `Return Alternate Hosts`_ spec for details.
