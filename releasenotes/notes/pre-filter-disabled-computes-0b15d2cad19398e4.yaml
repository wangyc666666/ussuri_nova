    A mandatory scheduling pre-filter has been added which will exclude
    disabled compute nodes where the related ``nova-compute`` service status
    is mirrored with a ``COMPUTE_STATUS_DISABLED`` trait on the compute node
    resource provider(s) for that service in Placement. See the
    `admin scheduler configuration docs`__ for details.
