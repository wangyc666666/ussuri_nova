deprecations:
  - |
    The xenapi driver is deprecated and may be removed in a future release.
    The driver is not tested by the OpenStack project nor does it have clear
    maintainer(s) and thus its quality can not be ensured. If you are using
    the driver in production please let us know in freenode IRC and/or the
    openstack-discuss mailing list.
