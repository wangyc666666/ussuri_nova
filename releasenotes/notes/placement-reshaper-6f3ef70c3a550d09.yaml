    Microversion 1.30 of the placement API adds support for a
    ``POST /reshaper`` resource that provides for atomically migrating resource
    provider inventories and associated allocations when some of the inventory
    moves from one resource provider to another, such as when a class of
    inventory moves from a parent provider to a new child provider.

    .. note:: This is a special operation that should only be used in rare
              cases of resource provider topology changing when inventory is in
              use. Only use this if you are really sure of what you are doing.
