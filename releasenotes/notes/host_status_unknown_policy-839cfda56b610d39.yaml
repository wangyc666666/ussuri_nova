    A new policy rule ``os_compute_api:servers:show:host_status:unknown-only``
    has been added to control whether a user can view a server host status of
    ``UNKNOWN`` in the following APIs:

    * ``GET /servers/{server_id}`` if using API microversion >= 2.16
    * ``GET /servers/detail`` if using API microversion >= 2.16
    * ``PUT /servers/{server_id}`` if using API microversion >= 2.75
    * ``POST /servers/{server_id}/action`` (rebuild) if using API microversion
      >= 2.75

    This is different than the ``os_compute_api:servers:show:host_status``
    policy rule which controls whether a user can view all possible host
    status in the aforementioned APIs including ``UP``, ``DOWN``,
    ``MAINTENANCE``, and ``UNKNOWN``.
