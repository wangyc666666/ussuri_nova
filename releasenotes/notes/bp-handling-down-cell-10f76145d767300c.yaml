    From microversion 2.69 the responses of ``GET /servers``,
    ``GET /servers/detail``, ``GET /servers/{server_id}`` and
    ``GET /os-services`` will contain missing keys during down cell situations
    because of adding support for returning minimal constructs based on the
    available information from the API database for those records in the
    down cells. See `Handling Down Cells`_ for more information on the missing
    keys.
