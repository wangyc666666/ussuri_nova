    * 400 for unknown param for query param and for request body.

    * Making server representation always consistent among GET, PUT
      and Rebuild serevr APIs response. ``PUT /servers/{server_id}``
      and ``POST /servers/{server_id}/action {rebuild}`` API response
      is modified to add all the missing fields which are return
      by ``GET /servers/{server_id}``.
    * Change the default return value of swap field from the empty
      string to 0 (integer) in flavor APIs.

    * Return ``servers`` field always in the response of GET
      hypervisors API even there are no servers on hypervisor.
