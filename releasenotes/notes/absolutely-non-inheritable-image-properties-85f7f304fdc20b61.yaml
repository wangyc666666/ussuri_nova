    In prior releases, an attempt to boot an instance directly from an image
    that was created by the Block Storage Service from an encrypted volume
    resulted in the instance going ACTIVE but being unusable.  If a user then
    performed the image-create action on such an instance, the new image would
    inherit the ``cinder_encryption_key_id`` and, beginning with the 20.0.0
    (Train) release, the ``cinder_encryption_key_deletion_policy`` image
    properties, assuming these were not included in the
    ``non_inheritable_image_properties`` configuration option.  (The default
    setting for that option does *not* include these.)  Beginning with 20.0.0
    (Train), when the new image was deleted, the encryption key for the
    *original* image would be deleted, thereby rendering it unusable for the
    normal workflow of creating a volume from the image and booting an instance
    from the volume.  Beginning with this release:

    * The Compute API will return a 400 (Bad Request) response to a request
      to directly boot an image created from an encrypted volume.
    * The image properties ``cinder_encryption_key_id`` and
      ``cinder_encryption_key_deletion_policy`` are absolutely non-inheritable
      regardless of the ``non_inheritable_image_properties`` setting.

    The ``non_inheritable_image_properties`` configuration option inhibits
    the transfer of image properties from the image an instance was created
    from to images created from that instance.  There are, however, image
    properties (for example, the properties used for image signature
    validation) that should *never* be transferred to an instance snapshot.
    Prior to this release, such properties were included in the default
    setting for this configuration option, but this allowed the possibility
    that they might be removed by mistake, thereby resulting in a poor user
    experience.  To prevent that from happening, nova now maintains an
    internal list of image properties that are absolutely non-inheritable
    regardless of the setting of the configuration option.  See the help
    text for ``non_inheritable_image_properties`` in the sample nova
    configuration file for details.
