    In deployments with Ironic, adds the ability for compute services to manage
    a subset of Ironic nodes. If the ``[ironic]/partition_key`` configuration
    option is set, the compute service will only consider nodes with a matching
    ``conductor_group`` attribute for management. Setting the
    ``[ironic]/peer_list`` configuration option allows this subset of nodes to
    be distributed among the compute services specified to further reduce
    failure domain. This feature is useful to co-locate nova-compute services
    with ironic-conductor services managing the same nodes, or to better
    control failure domain of a given compute service.
