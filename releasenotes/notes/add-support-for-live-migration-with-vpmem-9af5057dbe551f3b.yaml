    The libvirt driver now supports live migration with virtual persistent
    memory (vPMEM), which requires QEMU as hypervisor. In virtualization layer,
    QEMU will copy vpmem over the network like volatile memory, due to the
    typical large capacity of vPMEM, it may takes longer time for live
    migration.
