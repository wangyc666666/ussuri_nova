    Microversion 2.77 adds the optional parameter ``availability_zone`` to
    the ``unshelve`` server action API.

    * Specifying an availability zone is only allowed when the server status
      is ``SHELVED_OFFLOADED`` otherwise a 409 HTTPConflict response is
      returned.

    * If the ``[cinder]/cross_az_attach`` configuration option is False then
      the specified availability zone has to be the same as the availability
      zone of any volumes attached to the shelved offloaded server, otherwise
      a 409 HTTPConflict error response is returned.
