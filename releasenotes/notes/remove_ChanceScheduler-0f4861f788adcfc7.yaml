    The ``chance_scheduler`` scheduler driver was deprecated in Pike
    and has now been removed. You should enable the ``filter_scheduler``
    driver instead. If ``chance_scheduler`` behavior is desired
    (i.e. speed is valued over correctness) then configuring the
    ``filter_scheduler`` with only the ``AllHostsFilter`` enabled and
    adjusting ``[filter_scheduler]/host_subset_size`` will provide similar
    performance.
