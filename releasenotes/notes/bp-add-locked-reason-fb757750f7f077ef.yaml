    Added a new ``locked_reason`` option in microversion 2.73 to the
    ``POST /servers/{server_id}/action`` request where the action is lock.
    It enables the user to specify a reason when locking a server. This
    information will be exposed through the response of the following APIs:

    - ``GET servers/{server_id}``
    - ``GET /servers/detail``
    - ``POST /servers/{server_id}/action`` where the action is rebuild
    - ``PUT servers/{server_id}``

    In addition, ``locked`` will be supported as a valid filter/sort parameter
    for ``GET /servers/detail`` and ``GET /servers`` so that users can filter
    servers based on their locked value. Also the instance action versioned
    notifications for the lock/unlock actions now contain the ``locked_reason``
    field.
