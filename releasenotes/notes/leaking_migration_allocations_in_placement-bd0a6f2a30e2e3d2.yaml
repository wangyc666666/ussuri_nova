    Nova leaks resource allocations in placement during
    ``POST /servers/{server_id}/action (revertResize Action)`` and
    ``POST /servers/{server_id}/action (confirmResize Action)`` and
    ``POST /servers/{server_id}/action (os-migrateLive Action)`` and if the
    allocation held by the migration_uuid is modified in parallel with the
    lifecycle operation. Nova will log an ERROR and will put the server into
    ERROR state but will not delete the migration allocation. We assume that
    this can only happen if somebody outside of nova is actively changing the
    migration allocation in placement. Therefore it is not considered as a bug.
