    This release adds support for ``direct`` and ``virtio-forwarder`` VNIC
    types to the ``vrouter`` VIF type. In order to use these VNIC types,
    support is required from the version of OpenContrail, Contrail or Tungsten
    Fabric that is installed, as well the required hardware. At this time, the
    reference os-vif plugin is hosted on OpenContrail at
    https://github.com/Juniper/contrail-nova-vif-driver but is expected to
    transition to Tungsten Fabric in the future. Version 5.1 or later of the
    plugin is required to use these new VNIC types. Consult the `Tungsten
    Fabric documentation <https://tungstenfabric.github.io/website/>`_ for
    release notes, when available, about hardware support. For commercial
    support, consult the release notes from a downstream vendor.
