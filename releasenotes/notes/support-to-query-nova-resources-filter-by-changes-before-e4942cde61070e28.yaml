    Microversion 2.66 adds the optional filter parameter ``changes-before``
    which can be used to get resources changed before or equal to the
    specified date and time.

    Like the ``changes-since`` filter, the ``changes-before`` filter will
    also return deleted servers.

    This parameter (``changes-before``) does not change any read-deleted
    behavior in the os-instance-actions or os-migrations APIs.
    The os-instance-actions API with the 2.21 microversion allows retrieving
    instance actions for a deleted server resource. The os-migrations API
    takes an optional ``instance_uuid`` filter parameter but does not support
    returning deleted migration records.

    The ``changes-before`` request parameter can be passed to the servers,
    os-instance-action and os-migrations APIs:

    * ``GET /servers``
    * ``GET /servers/detail``
    * ``GET /servers/{server_id}/os-instance-actions``
    * ``GET /os-migrations``
