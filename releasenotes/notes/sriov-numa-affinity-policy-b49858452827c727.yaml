    Added support for instance-level PCI NUMA policies using the
    ``hw:pci_numa_affinity_policy`` flavor extra spec and
    ``hw_pci_numa_affinity_policy`` image metadata property.
    These apply to both PCI passthrough and SR-IOV devices,
    unlike host-level PCI NUMA policies configured via the
    ``alias`` key of the ``[pci] alias`` config option.
    See the `VM Scoped SR-IOV NUMA Affinity`_ spec for more
    info.
