    Microversion 2.79 adds support for specifying the ``delete_on_termination``
    field in the request body when attaching a volume to a server, to support
    configuring whether to delete the data volume when the server is destroyed.
    Also, ``delete_on_termination`` is added to the GET responses when showing
    attached volumes, and the ``delete_on_termination`` field is contained
    in the POST API response body when attaching a volume.

    The affected APIs are as follows:

    * ``POST /servers/{server_id}/os-volume_attachments``
    * ``GET /servers/{server_id}/os-volume_attachments``
    * ``GET /servers/{server_id}/os-volume_attachments/{volume_id}``
