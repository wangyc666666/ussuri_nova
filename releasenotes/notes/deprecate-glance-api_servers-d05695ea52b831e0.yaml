deprecations:
  - |
    The ``[glance]api_servers`` configuration option is deprecated and will be
    removed in a future release. Deployments should use standard keystoneauth1
    options to configure communication with a single image service endpoint.
    Any load balancing or high availability requirements should be satisfied
    outside of nova.
