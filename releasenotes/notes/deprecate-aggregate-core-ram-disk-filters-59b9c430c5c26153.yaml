deprecations:
  - |
    The ``AggregateCoreFilter``, ``AggregateRamFilter`` and
    ``AggregateDiskFilter`` are now deprecated.
    They will be removed in a future release and should no longer be used.
    Their functionality has been replaced with a placement native approach
    by combining host aggregate mirroring added in Rocky and initial allocation
    ratios added in Stein. See the `scheduler documentation`_ for details.
