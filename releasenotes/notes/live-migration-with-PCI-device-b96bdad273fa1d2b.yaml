    Live migration of an instance with PCI devices is now blocked
    in the following scenarios:

    1. Instance with non-network related PCI device.

    2. Instance with network related PCI device and either:

       a. Neutron does not support extended port binding API.
       b. Source or destination compute node does not support
          libvirt-sriov-live-migration.

    Live migration will fail with a user friendly error.

    .. note:: Previously, the operation would have failed with an obscure error
        resulting in the instance still running on the source node or ending up
        in an inoperable state.
