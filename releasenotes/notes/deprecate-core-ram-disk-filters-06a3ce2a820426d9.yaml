deprecations:
  - |
    The ``CoreFilter``, ``DiskFilter`` and ``RamFilter`` are now deprecated.
    VCPU, DISK_GB and MEMORY_MB filtering is performed natively using the
    Placement service when using the ``filter_scheduler`` driver. Users of the
    ``caching_scheduler`` driver may still rely on these filters but the
    ``caching_scheduler`` driver is itself deprecated. Furthermore, enabling
    these filters may incorrectly filter out baremetal nodes which must be
    `scheduled using custom resource classes <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/install/configure-nova-flavors.html>`_.
