  - |
    The ``[filter_scheduler]/soft_affinity_weight_multiplier`` and
    ``[filter_scheduler]/soft_anti_affinity_weight_multiplier`` configuration
    options now have a hard minimum value of 0.0. Also, the deprecated alias
    to the ``[DEFAULT]`` group has been removed so the options must appear in
    the ``[filter_scheduler]`` group.
