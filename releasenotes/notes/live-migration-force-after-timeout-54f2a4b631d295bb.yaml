features:
  - |
    A new configuration option ``[libvirt]/live_migration_timeout_action``
    is added. This new option will have choices ``abort`` (default)
    or ``force_complete``. This option will determine what actions will be
    taken against a VM after ``live_migration_completion_timeout`` expires.
    Currently nova just aborts the live migrate operation after completion
    timeout expires. By default, we keep the same behavior of aborting after
    completion timeout. ``force_complete`` will either pause the VM or trigger
    post-copy depending on if post copy is enabled and available.

    The ``[libvirt]/live_migration_completion_timeout`` is restricted by
    minimum 0 and will now raise a ValueError if the configuration option
    value is less than minimum value.

    Note if you configure Nova to have no timeout, post copy will never be
    automatically triggered. None of this affects triggering post copy via
    the force live-migration API, that continues to work in the same way.
upgrade:
  - |
    Config option ``[libvirt]/live_migration_progress_timeout`` was deprecated
    in Ocata, and has now been removed.

    Current logic in libvirt driver to auto trigger post-copy based on
    progress information is removed as it has `proved impossible`__ to detect
    when live-migration appears to be making little progress.
