    The code for the `placement service
    <https://docs.openstack.org/placement>`_ was moved to its own
    `repository <https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/placement>`_ in
    Stein. The placement code in nova has been deleted.

    If you upgraded your OpenStack deployment to Stein without switching to use
    the now independent placement service, you must do so before upgrading to
    Train. `Instructions <https://docs.openstack.org/placement/latest/upgrade/to-stein.html>`_
    for one way to do this are available.
