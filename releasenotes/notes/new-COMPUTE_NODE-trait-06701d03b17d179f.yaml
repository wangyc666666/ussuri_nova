    Starting in the Ussuri release, compute node resource providers are
    automatically marked with the ``COMPUTE_NODE`` trait. This allows them to
    be distinguished easily from other providers, including sharing and nested
    providers, as well as other non-compute-related providers in a deployment.
    To make effective use of this trait (e.g. for scheduling purposes), all
    compute nodes must be upgrade to Ussuri. Alternatively, you can manually
    add the trait to pre-Ussuri compute node providers via `openstack resource
    provider trait set
    <https://docs.openstack.org/osc-placement/train/cli/index.html#resource-provider-trait-set>`_
