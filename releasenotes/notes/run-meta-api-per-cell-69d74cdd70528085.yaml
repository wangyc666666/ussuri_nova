    Added configuration option ``[api]/local_metadata_per_cell`` to allow
    users to run Nova metadata API service per cell. Doing this could provide
    performance improvement and data isolation in a multi-cell deployment.
    But it has some caveats, see the
    `Metadata api service in cells v2 layout`_ for more details.
