    The libvirt compute driver will "reshape" VGPU inventories and allocations
    on start of the ``nova-compute`` service. This will result in moving
    VGPU inventory from the root compute node resource provider to a nested
    (child) resource provider in the tree and move any associated VGPU
    allocations with it. This will be a one-time operation on startup in Stein.
    There is no end-user visible impact for this; it is for internal resource
    tracking purposes. See the `spec`__ for more details.
