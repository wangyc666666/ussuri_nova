    This release contains a fix for `bug 1748697`_ which distinguishes between
    resize and cold migrate such that the ``allow_resize_to_same_host`` config
    option is no longer used to determine if a server can be cold migrated to
    the same compute service host. Now when requesting a cold migration the
    API will check if the source compute node resource provider has the
    ``COMPUTE_SAME_HOST_COLD_MIGRATE`` trait and if so the scheduler can select
    the source host. Note that the only in-tree compute driver that supports
    cold migration to the same host is ``VMwareVCDriver``.

    To support rolling upgrades with N-1 computes if a node does not report the
    trait and is old the API will fallback to the ``allow_resize_to_same_host``
    config option value. That compatibility will be removed in a subsequent
    release.
