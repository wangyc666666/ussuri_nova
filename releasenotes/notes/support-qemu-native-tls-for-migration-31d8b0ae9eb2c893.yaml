    The libvirt driver now supports "QEMU-native TLS" transport for live
    migration.  This will provide encryption for all migration streams,
    namely: guest RAM, device state and disks on a non-shared setup that are
    transported over NBD (Network Block Device), also called as "block
    migration".

    This can be configured via a new configuration attribute
    ``[libvirt]/live_migration_with_native_tls``.  Refer to its
    documentation in ``nova.conf`` for usage details.  Note that this is
    the preferred the way to secure all migration streams in an
    OpenStack network, instead of
    ``[libvirt]/live_migration_tunnelled``.
