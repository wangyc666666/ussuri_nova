    A new image metadata prefilter has been added to allow translation of
    hypervisor-specific device model requests to standard traits. When this
    feature is enabled, nova is able to utilize placement to select hosts that
    are capable of emulating the requested devices, avoiding hosts that
    could not support the request. This feature is currently supported by the
    libvirt driver and can be enabled by configuring the
    ``[scheduler]/image_metadata_prefilter`` to ``True`` in the controller
    ``nova.conf``.
