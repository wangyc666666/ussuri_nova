    `Numbered request groups`_ can be defined in the flavor extra_spec
    but they can come from other sources as well (e.g. neutron ports).
    If there is more than one numbered request group in the
    allocation candidate query and the flavor does not specify any
    group policy then the query will fail in placement as group_policy
    is mandatory in this case. Nova previously printed a warning to the
    scheduler logs but let the request fail. However the creator of
    the flavor cannot know if the flavor later on will be used in a boot
    request that has other numbered request groups. So nova will start
    defaulting the group_policy to 'none' which means that the resource
    providers fulfilling the numbered request groups can overlap.
    Nova will only default the group_policy if it is not provided in the flavor
    extra_spec, and there is more than one numbered request group present in
    the final request, and the flavor only provided one or zero of such groups.
