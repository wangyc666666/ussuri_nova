    Ironic nodes are now only scheduled using the ``resource_class`` field set
    on the node. CPUs, RAM, and disks are not reported to the resource tracker.
    Ironic nodes must have the ``resource_class`` field set before upgrading.
    Flavors must also be configured to use resource classes instead of node
    properties. See the `ironic flavor configuration guide
    <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/install/configure-nova-flavors.html>`_
    for more information on doing this.
