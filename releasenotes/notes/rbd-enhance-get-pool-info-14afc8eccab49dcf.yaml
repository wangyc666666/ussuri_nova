    The reporting for bytes available for RBD has been enhanced to accomodate
    `unrecommended
    <http://docs.ceph.com/docs/luminous/start/hardware-recommendations/#hard-disk-drives>`_
    Ceph deployments where multiple OSDs are running on a single disk. The new
    reporting method takes the number of configured replicas into consideration
    when reporting bytes available.
