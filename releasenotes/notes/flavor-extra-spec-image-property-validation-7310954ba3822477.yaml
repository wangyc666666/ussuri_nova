    With added validations for flavor extra-specs and image properties, the
    APIs for server create, resize and rebuild will now return 400 exceptions
    where they did not before due to the extra-specs or properties not being
    properly formatted or being mutually incompatible.

    For all three actions we will now check both the flavor and image to
    validate the CPU policy, CPU thread policy, CPU topology, memory topology,
    hugepages, serial ports, realtime CPU mask, NUMA topology details, CPU
    pinning, and a few other things.

    The main advantage to this is to catch invalid configurations as early
    as possible so that we can return a useful error to the user rather than
    fail later on much further down the stack where the operator would have
    to get involved.
