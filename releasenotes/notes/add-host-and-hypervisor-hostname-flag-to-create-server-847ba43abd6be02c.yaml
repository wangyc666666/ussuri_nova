    API microversion 2.74 adds support for specifying optional ``host``
    and/or ``hypervisor_hostname`` parameters in the request body of
    ``POST /servers``. These request a specific destination host/node
    to boot the requested server. These parameters are mutually exclusive
    with the special ``availability_zone`` format of ``zone:host:node``.
    Unlike ``zone:host:node``, the ``host`` and/or ``hypervisor_hostname``
    parameters still allow scheduler filters to be run. If the requested
    host/node is unavailable or otherwise unsuitable, earlier failure will
    be raised.
    There will be also a new policy named
    ``compute:servers:create:requested_destination``. By default,
    it can be specified by administrators only.
