    A new ``nova-manage`` command, ``placement audit``, has been added.
    This can be used to identify and optionally remove compute allocations in
    placement that are no longer referenced by existing instances or
    migrations. These orphaned allocations typically occur due to race
    conditions during instance migration or removal and will result in capacity
    issues if not addressed.
    For more details on CLI usage, see the man page entry:
