    Instance list operations across cells are now made more efficient by batching queries
    as a fraction of the total limit for a request. Before this, an instance list with a
    limit of 1000 records (the default) would generate queries to each cell with that
    limit, and potentially process/sort/merge $num_cells*$limit records, despite only
    returning $limit to the user. The strategy can now be controlled via
    ``[api]/instance_list_cells_batch_strategy`` and related options to either use
    fixed batch sizes, or a fractional value that scales with the number of configured
    cells.
