upgrade:
  - The ``nova-manage db online_data_migrations`` command
    will now fill missing ``virtual_interfaces`` records for instances
    created before the Newton release. This is related to a fix for
    https://launchpad.net/bugs/1751923 which makes the
    _heal_instance_info_cache periodic task in the ``nova-compute``
    service regenerate an instance network info cache from the current
    neutron port list, and the VIFs from the database are needed to
    maintain the port order for the instance.
