    In case of infrastructure failures like non-responsive cells, prior to
    `change e3534d`_ we raised an API 500 error. However currently when
    listing instances or migrations, we skip that cell and display results from
    the up cells with the aim of increasing availability at the expense of
    accuracy. If the old behaviour is desired, a new flag called
    ``CONF.api.list_records_by_skipping_down_cells`` has been added which can
    be set to False to mimic the old behavior. Both of these potential
    behaviors will be unified in an upcoming microversion done through the
    `blueprint handling-down-cell`_  where minimal constructs would be returned
    for the down cell instances instead of raising 500s or skipping down cells.
