    A new ``[libvirt]/rbd_connect_timeout`` configuration option has been
    introduced to limit the time spent waiting when connecting to a RBD cluster
    via the RADOS API. This timeout currently defaults to 5 seconds.

    This aims to address issues reported in `bug 1834048`_ where failures to
    initially connect to a RBD cluster left the nova-compute service inoperable
    due to constant RPC timeouts being hit.
