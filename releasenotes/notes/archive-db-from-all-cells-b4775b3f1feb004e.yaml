    Support for archiving deleted rows from the database across
    all cells has been added to the ``nova-manage db archive_deleted_rows``
    command. Specify the ``--all-cells`` option to run the process across all
    existing cells. It is only possible to archive all DBs from a node where
    the ``[api_database]/connection`` option is configured.
