    In this release support was added for two additional libvirt video models:
    ``gop``, the UEFI graphic output protocol device model; and the ``none``
    device model. Existing support for ``virtio`` has been extended to all
    architectures and may now be requested via the ``hw_video_model`` image
    metadata property. Prior to this release the ``virtio`` video model was
    unconditionally enabled for ``AARCH64``. This is unchanged but it can now
    be explicitly enabled on all supported architectures. The ``none`` video
    model can be used to disable emulated video devices when using pGPU or
    vGPU passthrough.
