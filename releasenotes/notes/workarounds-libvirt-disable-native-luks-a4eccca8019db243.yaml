    The ``[workarounds]/disable_native_luksv1`` configuration option has
    been introduced. This can be used by operators to workaround recently
    discovered performance issues found within the `libgcrypt library`__ used
    by QEMU when natively decrypting LUKSv1 encrypted disks. Enabling this
    option will result in the use of the legacy ``dm-crypt`` based os-brick
    provided encryptors.

    Operators should be aware that this workaround only applies when using the
    libvirt compute driver with attached encrypted Cinder volumes using the
    ``luks`` encryption provider. The ``luks2`` encryption provider will
    continue to use the ``dm-crypt`` based os-brick encryptors regardless of
    what this configurable is set to.

    This workaround is temporary and will be removed during the W release once
    all impacted distributions have been able to update their versions of the
    libgcrypt library.

    .. warning:: Operators must ensure no instances are running on the compute
      host before enabling this workaround. Any instances with encrypted LUKSv1
      disks left running on the hosts will fail to migrate or stop after this
      workaround has been enabled.
