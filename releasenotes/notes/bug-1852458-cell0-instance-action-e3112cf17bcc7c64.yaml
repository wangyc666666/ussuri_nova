    This release contains a fix for a `regression`__ introduced in 15.0.0
    (Ocata) where server create failing during scheduling would not result in
    an instance action record being created in the cell0 database. Now when
    creating a server fails during scheduling and is "buried" in cell0 a
    ``create`` action will be created with an event named
    ``conductor_schedule_and_build_instances``.
