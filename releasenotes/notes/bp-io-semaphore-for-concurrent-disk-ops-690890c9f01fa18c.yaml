    Introduced a new config option ``[compute]/max_concurrent_disk_ops`` to
    reduce disk contention by specifying the maximum number of concurrent
    disk-IO-intensive operations per compute service.  This would include
    operations such as image download, image format conversion, snapshot
    extraction, etc.
    The default value is 0, which means that there is no limit.
