    The *cells v1* feature has been deprecated since the 16.0.0 Pike release
    and has now been removed. The ``nova-cells`` service and ``nova-manage
    cells`` commands have been removed, while the ``nova-manage cell_v2
    simple_cell_setup`` command will no longer check if cells v1 is enabled and
    therefore can no longer exit with ``2``.

    The *cells v1* specific REST APIs have been removed along with their
    related policy rules. Calling these APIs will now result in a ``410
    (Gone)`` error response.

    * ``GET /os-cells``
    * ``POST /os-cells``
    * ``GET /os-cells/capacities``
    * ``GET /os-cells/detail``
    * ``GET /os-cells/info``
    * ``POST /os-cells/sync_instances``
    * ``GET /os-cells/{cell_id}``
    * ``PUT /os-cells/{cell_id}``
    * ``DELETE /os-cells/{cell_id}``
    * ``GET /os-cells/{cell_id}/capacities``

    The *cells v1* specific policies have been removed.

    * ``cells_scheduler_filter:DifferentCellFilter``
    * ``cells_scheduler_filter:TargetCellFilter``

    The *cells v1* specific configuration options, previously found in
    ``cells``, have been removed.

    * ``enabled``
    * ``name``
    * ``capabilities``
    * ``call_timeout``
    * ``reserve_percent``
    * ``cell_type``
    * ``mute_child_interval``
    * ``bandwidth_update_interval``
    * ``instance_update_sync_database_limit``
    * ``mute_weight_multiplier``
    * ``ram_weight_multiplier``
    * ``offset_weight_multiplier``
    * ``instance_updated_at_threshold``
    * ``instance_update_num_instances``
    * ``max_hop_count``
    * ``scheduler``
    * ``rpc_driver_queue_base``
    * ``scheduler_filter_classes``
    * ``scheduler_weight_classes``
    * ``scheduler_retries``
    * ``scheduler_retry_delay``
    * ``db_check_interval``
    * ``cells_config``

    In addition, the following *cells v1* related RPC configuration options,
    previously found in ``upgrade_levels``, have been removed.
