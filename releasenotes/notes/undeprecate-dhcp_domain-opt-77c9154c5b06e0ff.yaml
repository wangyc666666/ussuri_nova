    The ``dhcp_domain`` option has been undeprecated and moved to the ``[api]``
    group. It is used by the metadata service to configure fully-qualified
    domain names for instances, in addition to its role configuring DHCP
    services for *nova-network*. This use case was missed when deprecating the
    option initially.
