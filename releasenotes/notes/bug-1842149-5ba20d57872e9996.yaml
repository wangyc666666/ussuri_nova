    A new pair of ``ssl_ciphers`` and ``ssl_minimum_version`` configuration
    options have been introduced for use by the ``nova-novncproxy``,
    ``nova-serialproxy``, and ``nova-spicehtml5proxy`` services.  These new
    options allow one to configure the allowed TLS ciphers and minimum protocol
    version to enforce for incoming client connections to the proxy services.

    This aims to address the issues reported in `bug 1842149`_, where it
    describes that the proxy services can inherit insecure TLS ciphers
    and protocol versions from the compiled-in defaults of the OpenSSL
    library on the underlying system.  The proxy services provided no way
    to override such insecure defaults with current day generally accepted
    secure TLS settings.
