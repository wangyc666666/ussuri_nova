    CI testing of Cells v1 has been moved to the ``experimental`` queue meaning
    changes proposed to nova will not be tested against a Cells v1 setup unless
    explicitly run through the ``experimental`` queue by leaving a review
    comment on the patch of "check experimental". Cells v1 has been deprecated
    since the 16.0.0 Pike release and this is a further step in its eventual
    removal.
