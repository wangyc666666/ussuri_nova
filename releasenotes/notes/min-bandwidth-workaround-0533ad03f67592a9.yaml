    Nova leaks bandwidth resources if a bound port that has QoS minimum
    bandwidth rules is deleted in Neutron before the port is logically detached
    from the server. To avoid any leaks, users should detach the port from the
    server using the Nova API first before deleting the port in Neutron. If the
    server is in a state such that the port cannot be detached using the Nova
    API, bandwidth resources will be freed when the server is deleted. Another
    alternative to clean up the leak is to remove the
    ``NET_BW_EGR_KILOBIT_PER_SEC`` and/or ``NET_BW_IGR_KILOBIT_PER_SEC``
    allocations related to the deleted port for the server `using the CLI`_.
    See related bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1820588 for more
    details.
