    Stable device rescue for boot from volume instances is now supported
    through the use of the 2.87 microversion when the compute hosting the
    instance also reports the ``COMPUTE_RESCUE_BFV`` trait such as the libvirt
    driver.

    No changes have been made to the request or reponse parameters of the
    rescue API itself.
