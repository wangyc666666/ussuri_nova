    With microversion 2.85, existing policy ``os-volumes-attachments:update``
    is used for updating the resources with the change in its default value
    from ``SYSTEM_ADMIN`` to ``PROJECT_MEMBER_OR_SYSTEM_ADMIN``.
    New policy ``os-volumes-attachments:swap`` is introduced for swapping
    the attachment of servers with default to ``SYSTEM_ADMIN``.
