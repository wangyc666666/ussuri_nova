upgrade:
  - |
    The ``nova-consoleauth`` service has been deprecated and new consoles will
    have their token authorizations stored in cell databases, in addition to
    the ``nova-consoleauth`` service backend, in Rocky. With this, console
    proxies are required to be deployed per cell. All existing consoles will be
    reset. For most operators, this should be a minimal disruption as the
    default TTL of a console token is 10 minutes.

    Operators that have configured a much longer token TTL or otherwise wish to
    avoid immediately resetting all existing consoles can use the new
    configuration option ``[workarounds]/enable_consoleauth`` to fall back on
    the ``nova-consoleauth`` service for locating existing console
    authorizations. The option defaults to False. Once all of the existing
    consoles have naturally expired, operators may unset the configuration
    option. For example, if a deployment has configured a token TTL of one
    hour, the operator may disable the ``[workarounds]/enable_consoleauth``
    option, one hour after deploying the new code.

    .. note:: Cells v1 was not converted to use the database backend for
      console token authorizations. Cells v1 console token authorizations will
      continue to be supported by the ``nova-consoleauth`` service and use of
      the ``[workarounds]/enable_consoleauth`` option does not apply to
      Cells v1 users.
