    A new ``[workarounds]/reserve_disk_resource_for_image_cache`` config
    option was added to fix the `bug 1878024`_ where the images in the compute
    image cache overallocate the local disk. If this new config is set then the
    libvirt driver will reserve DISK_GB resources in placement based on the
    actual disk usage of the image cache.
